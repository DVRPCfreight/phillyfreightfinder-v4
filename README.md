# PhillyFreightFinder-v4
DVRPC's PhillyFreightFinder (PFF) is a data platform and visualization tool for Greater Philadelphia's freight economy and transportation system. This tool was developed in-house by DVRPC staff with the goal of extending the utility and visibility of key freight information.

The project is a refactor of the PFF web application using Vue, Nuxt, and Tailwind CSS.
